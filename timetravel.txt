Relationship between HEAD, branch and commits

                           ↓
                         master
                           ↓
commit1 --- commit2 --- commit3(most recent)

- Checkout case: HEAD references specific commit which is not referenced by branch (e.g.master)
              HEAD      master
               ↓          ↓
commit1 --- commit2 --- commit3(most recent)
