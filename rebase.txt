        useful when frequent update by collaborators occurs during not working on my own main branch

- list of commits which can be used for rebase
    - pick: use the commit
    - reword: use the commit, but edit the commit message
    - edit: use commit, but stop for amending
    - fixup: use commit contents but meld it into previous commit and discard the commit message
    - drop: remove commit (and content of the commit entirely)
