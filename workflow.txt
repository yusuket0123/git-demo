### Description of workflow ###

Type of Workflow
1. Centralized Workflow: everyone works in master branch
    Assumed Problems: cann't push cuz haven't pull the up-to-date version from github
    → git stash (preserve what is supposed to update to github) and git pull
2. Feature Branches (Much better than centralized approach)
    - Master/Main is treated as the official project history
    → Master/Main won't contain broken code
    - all new development should be done on seperate branches
    → When each work has done, it can be merged into Master/Main
