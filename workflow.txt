### Description of workflow ###

Type of Workflow
1. Centralized Workflow: everyone works in master branch
    Assumed Problems: cann't push cuz haven't pull the up-to-date version from github
    → git stash (preserve what is supposed to update to github) and git pull
2. Feature Branches (Much better than centralized approach)
    - Master/Main is treated as the official project history
    → Master/Main won't contain broken code
    - all new development should be done on seperate branches
    → When each work has done, it can be merged into Master/Main

How collaborator can send a request to admin 
0. merge changes into master branch
1. Send a message and discuss
2. pull request on the github website
3. approval of pull request

How admin can resolve conflict
> git fetch origin
> git switch my-new-Feature
> merge master
> fix conflicts!
> git switch master
> git merge my-new-feature
> git push origin master

Forking
: make a personal copy of some repo on github
- On open project, we can do pull request through our own fork
- the update of the original repo isn't reflected on fork automatically
    → stay up to date with what's happening on a original repo
    > git remote add upstream
